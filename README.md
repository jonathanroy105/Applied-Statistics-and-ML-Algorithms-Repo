**Introduction**
This repository showcases my work on multiple datasets, focusing on understanding the data, extracting insights, and building predictive models. 
It covers a range of tasks, including data cleaning, EDA, basic statistical analysis, and the implementation of various machine learning algorithms.

**Project Structure**
The repository is organized into folders, each representing a separate dataset and project. 
Each folder contains:

-> Data: The dataset used for analysis (if applicable).
-> Notebooks: Jupyter notebooks for EDA, statistics, and machine learning models.
-> Scripts: Python scripts for running the analysis.
-> Results: Outputs such as charts, model evaluation metrics, and predictions.

**Datasets**
The datasets used in this repository vary across projects and domains. Each project folder contains information about the specific dataset used, including:

-> Source of the dataset
-> Data cleaning steps
-> Features and target variables

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
In the EDA section, the following analyses are typically performed:

-> Descriptive statistics
-> Visualization of distributions, correlations, and trends
-> Identifying outliers and missing values
-> Feature engineering and transformations

**Basic Statistics**
For each project, basic statistical analysis is conducted, including:

-> Measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode)
-> Measures of dispersion (variance, standard deviation)
-> Hypothesis testing
-> Chi-Square testing
-> Correlation analysis

**Machine Learning Algorithms**
A variety of machine learning algorithms are applied across projects, including:

#Supervised Learning:
-> Linear Regression
-> Logistic Regression
-> Decision Trees
-> Random Forest
-> Support Vector Machines (SVM)
-> k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
-> XGBoost and LGBM
-> Neural Networks
-> Time Series Analysis

#Unsupervised Learning:
-> Clustering (KMeans and DBSCAN)
-> PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
-> Association Rules
-> Reccomendation Systems

For each model:
-> Data is split into training and testing sets.
-> Hyperparameter tuning is conducted (where applicable).
-> Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC are reported.
